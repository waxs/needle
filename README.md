# Needle JS
![test](https://github.com/waxs/needle/workflows/test/badge.svg?branch=master)

Needle is a fast, small, clean and flexible package for finding your needle in a haystack of data. Needle has some 
simple helpers to quickly differentiate your data using chained methods while being only `~18.5KB` (and ~5,5KB gzipped)
 in size.

Imagine having to retrieve all items that are active, pretty easy right? These days use an array `.filter()` and you're 
pretty much done. Now consider retrieving all names of the active records in september 2020 where the age is equal to 30. 
This is where Needle comes with just 5 lines of code. 

```javascript
needle
    .is('active')
    .month('created', 'sep', 2020)
    .where('age', 30)
    .values('name');
```

üöß Package is under development in beta version. 

## Initiate Needle JS
To use Needle we initiate the class as follows, the class expects an array of objects. 
Let's stick with a clean setup for now. You can also use a setter `needle.data = [{...}]` or a getter `needle.data` 
to retrieve the data from Needle.

```javascript
const data = [{...}];
const needle = new Needle(data);
```

## Getting started
Needle has been build taking intuitive use in account. There are multiple helpers to help you sort, retrieve or 
manipulate an array of contents. Let's dive a little deeper into the options you can use with Needle.

## Examples
This repository holds multiple examples of using Needle JS with a simple `index.html` that will visualise results and
 data. The fastest way getting started with Needle is to play around with these examples, you will find that working 
 with the methods of Needle is fast and simple. Let's take a look at a simple example of the ease of use of Needle.
```javascript
const data = [
    {
        active: true,
        created: '1/1/2020',
        name: 'Sander',
        age: 30,
        city: 'Amsterdam'
    },
    {
        active: true,
        created: '7/10/2019',
        name: 'John',
        age: 45,
        city: 'New York'
    },
    {
        active: false,
        created: '3/20/2019',
        name: 'Sara',
        age: 26
    }
]

const needle = new Needle(data);

needle
    .between('age', [20, 40])
    .has('city')
    .log();
```
The example above will return the first object in the array and log the result to the console. This is because 
Sara is lacking a city, and the `has()` method returns only items that have a given key present in the object. 

![Example](http://sanderhidding.nl/assets/needle-example.jpg)
The example folder contains multiple simple queries and visualisations in tables to illustrate the use of Needle in 
real time. 

## Development
Needle methods can be tested using Jest, running the `npm run test` command will execute a number of test to make 
sure basic functionality is working as expected. Test scripts can be found in the `test` folder.  

### Testing   
We did a stress test on working with a large data set. We can never assume, at least not for now, that JS 
will outperform the magic of SQL, and this is also not what we were aiming for. In this case Needle hold up pretty well 
going through a massive mockup file containing over `250.000 lines` of data with over `5500 unique items`. This is 
however no guarantee that your dataset will hold up. Overall performance will vary, some keys might hold extensive 
strings or array's containing multiple strings. It's always wise to limit your dataset as much as possible to achieve
 a better performance. If you like to experience performance yourself generate some JSON online and pass it to Needle. 

**Some tips on making the most out of the limitations of JS.** 
* Chain your queries wisely, limit the size first with simple queries.
* Some queries are more expensive to run, if you limit your data set using the `select()` method first your 
      second query will have less intense data to work with.
* Most API's have options to limit data, don't take it to far, have a talk with your backend engineer, or use 
     native functions to specify your needs first ;)

## About
This repository is mainly intended as an experiment and to have some fun, a folder with examples is available within 
this repo showing multiple examples as documented above. Check out my [personal website](http://sanderhidding.nl) for 
more information. That's all folks! Cheers.
